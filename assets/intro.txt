Increasing water scarcity is an entrenched problem that faces Jordan. The country is naturally characterized by an arid to semi-arid climate. Water scarcity is compounded by population growth and increasing demands on limited water resources. Climate change is anticipated to reduce long-term conventional water resources (Ministry of Environment, 2021). The combined impact of these factors will likely affect all human activities and the country's economic development.
The Water Efficiency and Conservation (WEC) Activity contributes to USAID/Jordan's Country Development Cooperation Strategy's (CDC: 2020-2025) five-year goals of supporting Jordan to advance its stability, prosperity, and self-reliance by spurring including private sector-led economic growth, improving water security, strengthening accountable governance, fostering a healthy, well-educated population, and enhancing the agency and leadership of women and youth.
The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) is non-profit research for development organization headquartered in Colombo, Sri Lanka, with offices throughout Asia, and Africa, including a regional office for the MENA region in Egypt with a team in Jordan. IWMI is a member of the CGIAR System of international agricultural research centers, a global research partnership for a food-secure future dedicated to reducing poverty, enhancing food and nutrition security, and improving natural resources. IWMI's vision is a water-secure world, and our mission is to provide water solutions for sustainable, climate-resilient development. IWMI has conducted active research programs in Jordan since the 2000s and the latest contributions in Jordan included Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) inputs to the USAID’s Water Innovation Technologies (WIT) project, leading the field-scale monitoring and evaluation of water savings generated from adopting water-saving technologies across agriculture and domestic sectors and communal water use.
