Land use/land cover is a critical requirement for the WA+ framework since it directly affects the water balance. The WaPOR database contains yearly land use data from 2009 to present at a 100 m resolution. The WaPOR land use data  for 2015-2021 was selected for water accounting. Prior land use mapping done in the basin including irrigated areas by GIZ was not available at the time of this study so the globally available product WaPOR land use was used. The WA+ land and water use categories were further simplified into 3 major land and water management classes: 
1.Natural landscapes: these are land use classes where there is limited human intervention. These also include conservation zones.
2. Agricultural landscape: These are both rainfed and irrigated agricultural areas. 
3. Urban landscapes: Areas of significant land modification which is not agricultural. These include paved surfaces, lots and roads.
The resulting map (Figure 4) indicates different land and water use characteristics across the watershed. Land use in the Amann-Zarqa is primarily natural landscape accounting for 70% of the basin, agricultural land use comprises 23% of the basin and urban landscapes occupy 7% of the watershed (Table 1) Of the agricultural landscape, majority is rainfed and only 76 km2 is observed to be irrigated agriculture.
