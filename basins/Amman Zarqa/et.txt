MOD16 ET was the least performing (basin average RMSE = 0.02, KGE= 0.39, R2 =0.76, d = 0.83)  product in comparison to the station data across all the stations. This was due to the fact that there were only 2 stations with usable MODIS data due to several missing values at the other pixel locations and also the MODIS product estimated lower ET values and unable to capture the larger evaporation values. Also, annual ET for the various products indicates ET from most products estimates relatively higher ET values (76-248 mm/year) for the basin, while MOD16 estimates relatively low ET values (40-58 mm/year). These were much lower than reported literature values of 129-205 mm/year (Basin et al., 2023; Taran, 2021)  for the Amman Zarqa basin (Table 2).
