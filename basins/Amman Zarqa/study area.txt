The Amman Zarqa basin covers approximately an area of 4,100 km2, with a large portion (over 93% of the basin) located in Jordan and 7% in Syria (Figure 1). A large portion of Jordan’s population are dependent on the various agricultural and industrial activities that the basin supports. The outflow of the basin serves as irrigation water source for the greater Jordan Valley (Al-Omari et al., 2013; Amdar et al., 2024; Hammouri & El-Naqa, 2007).
Annual precipitation ranges from 50 mm/year in the east to more than 500 mm/year in the northwest near Ajloun and in the southwest of Amman near Umm as Summaq. These variations, primarily due to topographic influences, result in an estimated long-term average annual precipitation volume of 782 (Mm3/year) (MWI, 2023).
