Mujib basin is a 6600 km2 watershed located in central Jordan (Figure 1). It drains to the Dead Sea through two Wadis: Wadi Mujib which drains much of the southern part of the basin and Wadi Wala which drains the northern part of the basin. The basin is bounded by the Dead Sea in the west, Amman-Zarqa basin in the north , Azraq, and Sirhan basins in the East and Hasa  basin in the south (Abu-Allaban et al., 2015). The basin has a typical semi-arid to arid climate, with high temperatures during the summer months and low rainfall during the winter. The climate varies between dry–hot summer and rainy–mild winter in the western and northern parts of the Mujib basin to dry–hot–dusty summer and cold winter in eastern and southern parts  (Abu-Allaban et al., 2015). The rainy season begins in October and lasts until May, with most of the rainfall occurring in the month of January.
